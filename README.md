## Evilginx3 Discord Phishlet
This is for Evilginx version 3.0+ only. Legacy Evilginx2 Discord phishlet by @mrgretzky is no longer supported.


## Important Note

Discord is continually enhancing and updating its login and authorization process, including security measures and related functionalities. Because of this, the script may become outdated in the near future. I will try to keep it updated so it works without any problems. 
However, please be aware that there may be some delays as these changes occur rather frequently.
